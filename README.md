# FORSITE Forest Recovery

This repo contains code related to quantifying the recovery of forests surrounding the city of Sudbury in Ontario, Canada. This project falls under Forsite, an innitiative to improve the monitoring of forests across Canada to improve forest health and reporting. Scripts within this repo combine remote sensing (Landsat, hyperspectral, and LiDAR) and ground measurements (field plots, species ID, DBH, etc) to determine the recovery of forests following mining acidification.
